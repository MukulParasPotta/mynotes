                    <p>For my journey, I've used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a>, but you can use any editor/IDE of your choice. But make sure it has Flutter (and Dart) plugins to make life easier.</p>
                    <p>Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to call up the command line in VS Code (something similar exists for the IDE you're using, unless it doesn't support plugins), which lets you utilize the plugins installed.</p>
                    <p>Find Flutter commands, which must contain something like <mark>Flutter: New * Project</mark>. Here, * can be:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Application</li>
                            <li>Package</li>
                            <li>Module</li>
                            <li>Plugin</li>
                        </ul>
                        depending on your project, you can create any of the above, but I proceeded with an Application.
