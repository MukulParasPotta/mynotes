                <p>
                    Flutter needs JDK 8 so make sure it is installed and configured properly.
                    <br>
                    <code>sudo apt-get install openjdk-8</code>
                    <br>
                    or follow <a href="https://dev.to/ejgamer21/install-flutter-without-android-studio-58bi">this</a> process to setup Flutter.
                    This concludes all the pre-requisites. 
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Run <br> <code>flutter doctor</code> <br> to verify the installation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once that is done, you might have to run <br> <code>flutter doctor --android-licenses</code> <br>
                    to review and accept the licenses of the software used as part of Flutter.</p>
